# mixer-client-csharp
A C# client library for the Mixer streaming service

## What is this?
Unsatisfied with the current set of APIs that exist to interact with Mixer, I took some time to build and design an API set in C# to interact with the service. This API set can be used by anyone to build out any apps they wish to use and itâ€™s very easy to setup.

## Current functionality
Most of the standard REST web API functions exist with some exceptions as I need to spent more time researching & testing them. I also plan to add API support for interactivity features when I get the chance.

## Feature roadmap
These are the current planned features to be developed in priority order:
- Finish full REST web API functionality with associated unit tests
- Develop interactive API functionality, unit tests, and sample app
- Develop full-scale sample app using both REST web APIs and interactive APIs
- Add ViewModels to all APIs to make ramp-up development work easier and put less focus on knowing the dev docs top-to-bottom

## How do I get started using it?
There are two sample apps created the help showcase some the setup needed and how to use the APIs. Additionally, there are a large serious of unit tests that go through all of the individual functionality that you can look at. I plan on creating more formal documentation soon.

## I found a bug, who do I contact?
Just head over to the https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/issues page and create a new issue.

## I have a new feature idea!
Submit feature requests at the https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/issues page or feel free to develop the feature yourself and submit a pull request at https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/pulls! I'm happy to assist anyone if they're interested in developing something as well.
